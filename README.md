"Adorable Animals Website"

This website was written by Monica Davidson and is written in HTML and CSS. 

The website begins with a navigation bar at the very top middle. There are five links available for the user to click on. All links go to a funny video or photograph. Below the navigation bar is a "Welcome" sign.

In the body of the website is a photograph of a puppy. A speech bubble was positioned to look as though the puppy is talking to the user.
Some text is located below the photograph of the puppy and allows the user to submit a photograph (this is disabled at the moment). 

On the left side of the website are circles that alternate in color; this is to add a little more design to the website.

Footer holds copyright information.

A CSS is attached to the HTML along with a normalize.css.
